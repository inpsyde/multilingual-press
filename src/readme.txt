Create a fast translation network on WordPress multisite.

== Description ==

Run each language in a separate site, and connect the content in a lightweight user interface. Use a customizable widget
to link to all sites.

This plugin lets you connect an unlimited amount of sites with each other.
Set a main language for each site, create relationships (connections), and start writing. You get a new field now to
create a linked post on all the connected sites automatically.
They are accessible via the post/page editor screen - you can switch back and forth to translate them.

In contrast to most other translation plugins there is **no lock-in effect**: When you disable our plugin, all sites
will still work as separate sites without any data-loss or garbage output.

Our **Language Manager** offers 174 languages, and you can edit them.

= Features =

- Set up unlimited site relationships in the site manager.
- Language Manager with 174 editable languages.
- Edit all translations for a post or page from the original post editor without the need to switch sites.
- Show a list of links for all translations on each page in a flexible widget.
- Translate posts, pages and taxonomy terms like categories or tags.
- Add translation links to any nav menu.
- No lock-in: After deactivation, all sites will still work.
- SEO-friendly URLs and permalinks.
- Support for top-level domains per language (via multisite domain mapping).
- Automatic `hreflang` support.
- Support for custom post types.
- Automatically redirect to the user's preferred language version of a post.
- Duplicate sites. Use one site as template for new site and copy *everything:* Posts, attachments, settings for plugins
and themes, navigation menus, categories, tags and custom taxonomies.
- Synchronized trash: move all connected post to trash with one click.
- Change relationships between translations or connect existing posts.
- Quicklinks. Add links to language alternatives to a post automatically to the post content. This is especially useful
when you don't use widgets or a sidebar.
- User specific language settings for the back-end. Every user can choose a preferred language for the user interface
without affecting the output of the front-end.
- Show posts with incomplete translations in a dashboard widget.

We cannot guarantee free ad hoc support. Please be patient, we are a small team.
You can follow our progress and development notices on our
[developer blog](http://make.multilingualpress.org).

= Premium Support =

We also offer [premium support](https://multilingualpress.org) to save your time.
You get direct help from the developers of the plugin-and support the development.

= WPML to MultilingualPress =

If you would like to switch from the WPML plugin to MultilingualPress, you can use the helping hands of
[WPML to MultilingualPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpml-to-multilingualpress/). This plugin converts posts from
an existing WPML multilingual site via XLIFF export/import for MultilingualPress.

= Crafted by Inpsyde =
The team at [Inpsyde](http://inpsyde.com) is engineering the Web since 2006.

== Installation ==

= Requirements =
- WordPress Multisite 4.2+.
- PHP 5.2.4, newer PHP versions will work faster.

If you're new to WordPress multisite, you might find our [WordPress multisite installation
tutorial](http://make.multilingualpress.org/2014/02/how-to-install-multi-site/) helpful.

Use the installer via back-end of your install or ...

1. Unpack the download-package.
2. Upload the files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the **Network/Plugins** menu in WordPress and click **Network Activate**.
4. Go to **All Sites**, **Edit** each site, then select the tab **MultilingualPress** to configure the settings. You
need at least two sites with an assigned language.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will MultilingualPress translate my content? =

No, it will not. It manages relationships between sites and translations, but it doesn't change the content.

= Can I use MultilingualPress on a single-site installation? =

That would require changes to the way WordPress stores post content. Other plugins do that; we think this is wrong,
because it creates a lock-in: you would lose access to your content after the plugin deactivation.

= I'm new to WordPress multisite. Are there any tutorials to get me started? =

Yes, just have a look at our [WordPress multisite installation
tutorial](http://make.multilingualpress.org/2014/02/how-to-install-multi-site/).

= 2.1.2 =
- Combine all scripts and stylesheets, separated for frontend and backend.
- Minify scripts and stylesheets when `SCRIPT_DEBUG` and `MULTILINGUALPRESS_DEBUG` are not set.
- Make the icon/flag for the current site available in nav menus.
- Sites with custom name are now returned in `Mlp_Language_Api::get_translations()`.
- Better updates: Make sure that site relations are not lost and languages are not duplicated.

= 2.1.1 =
- Fixed autoloading with `glob()` on Solaris systems.
- Fixed database error when upgrading from a preview version of the 2.1 branch.
- Custom flags are now fetched from the correct site.
- Built-in flag icons are checked on the file system before we return an URL for them.
- Language switcher widget is now visible for all users.
- Improved description of the widget options.
- Search pages are translated correctly.
- Pro: Table duplicator works with custom tables now.

= 2.1.0 =
- Added links to translations to the `head` element.
- Relations between sites are now stored in a separate table `mlp_site_relations`. This is faster than the previous
option call, and it is less error prone, because we don’t have to synchronize these relations between sites. The old
options will be imported into the table automatically during the upgrade.
- Pro: Post meta fields in poorly written plugins will not be overwritten anymore. We had many reports about plugins
without a check for the current site when they write meta fields. Now we remove all global post data before we
synchronize the posts, and we restore them when we are done.
- Installation and uninstallation are heavily improved now. We catch many more edge cases and switches from Free to Pro.
- Languages are now synchronized between MultilingualPress and WordPress. When you assign a language in
MultilingualPress to a site the first time and the language files are available, we set the site language in the
WordPress option to that value.
- You can add language links to regular navigation menus in the backend now. These links are adjusted automatically on
each site: if there is a dedicated translation, the link will be changed to that page. It will point to the other site’s
front page otherwise.
- Users who are not logged in will not get permalinks for non-public sites anymore. You can work on a new site now
safely, test all the links while being logged in, and your visitors will never see that until you set the site to
public.
- You can link existing terms (tags, categories, whatever) now. We will add support for term creation on that page
later.
- There are hundreds of other, minor improvements, too many to list them all.
