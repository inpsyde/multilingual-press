# Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* See if your issue has been discussed (or even fixed) earlier. You can [search for existing issues](https://github.com/inpsyde/multilingual-press/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).
* Assuming it does not already exist, [create a new issue](https://github.com/inpsyde/multilingual-press/issues/new).
	* Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
	* Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

# Making Changes
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
	* This is usually the `master` branch.
	* Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
	* To quickly create a topic branch based on the `master` branch:
	    * `git checkout -b issue/%YOUR-ISSUE-NUMBER%_%DESCRIPTIVE-TITLE% master`
	    * a good example is `issue/118_html_lang_attribute`
	* Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commit messages are helpful.

# Submitting Changes
* Push your changes to the according topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* [Create a pull request](https://github.com/inpsyde/multilingual-press/compare) to our repository.
* Wait for feedback. The MLP team looks at pull requests on a regular basis.
